# Domotic-Chalet
Remote management of second home.

-------------------------------------***PROJECT***-------------------------------------

The second home is far, about 1 hour of drive and it is a cottage in montains.
When new people want to come, it's cold inside. We can not come before and turn on the heating, it's not economic and ecofriendly.
So, we want a domotic solution for enable or disable heating and more option as possible.

There are no internet connection in the cottage, so we need another solution without internet to communicate with the systeme.
Consequently, we have thinking to use GSM communication.

We want with an order by text message:
Enable or disable heating
Enable or disable motion detection
Send alert by text message when the mode is enable and the motion detector detect someone
Reply the temperature and humidity of the room after request
